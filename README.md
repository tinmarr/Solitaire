# Rules

Rules are from <i>The Book of Classic Board Games</i> by Sid Sackson

## Basic Rules

Every move has to be a capture.
Captures are made by hopping along a line over an adjecent piece and removing it.
You can make a capture, the switch to another piece to make another capture, even if the first piece still has captures available to it.<br>
Continue hopping, and removing pieces, until all available captures have been made.

## Winning

If only on piece remains, that's a second place finish.
If, however, that last piece is located on the central point, that's a complete victory.
